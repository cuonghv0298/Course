Algorithm Analysis
I've learned that algorithm analysis is a critical aspect of computer science and software engineering. It involves evaluating the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity. Understanding time and space complexity notations like Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega helps in making informed decisions when selecting algorithms for specific tasks
